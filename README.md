Contact List:
An application that takes contact information from the user and stores in a sql database and displays the contacts in a table using 2 virtual webservers and 1 virtual database server. 

To run our application clone the repository to a desired directory. Use the command 'cd' in terminal followed by the cloned directory name and then run "vagrant up --provider virtualbox" in the terminal. Once this has been done visit the webpage on 192.168.34.11 to add a contact to your contact list.
